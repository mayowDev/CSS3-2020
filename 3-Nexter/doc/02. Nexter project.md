- if we want the section/row o have the height of it's content we set to min-content or auto
- grid-template-rows: 80vh min-content 40vw repeat(3, min-content);
- in above example, we place values based on how many sections we have on the page 
* 1st it's for header section/row which is 80vh .
* 2nd it's for features scetion/row and we set to min-content, because we want the row to expand as content increases.
* 3rd it's for story section/row and we set 40vw beacuse it's two column layout as we shrink the width content adabtes, same as header
* 4th it's for homes section and we set to min-content 
* 5th it's for gallery section and we set to min-content 
* 6th it's for footer section and we set to min-content 
- so instead of writitng for each of last 3 setcions a min-content we use repeat(3, min-content).


## Topic - 2&3 Building Overall Layout

- we start  with 8 columns then add a side bar then add 1 column on each side of the 8 columns
- 80px 1 column on the left as sidebar 8 column on the middle
- place the 8 columns in center b/w the side bar and end of the page by adding 1 column on each side of the 8 columns. incase we dont have the sidebar then we will use margin: 0 auto; to center it.
- and also we should have couple full-blead section from left to right

- most of the columns are important to name compare to row.


grid-template-columns: [sidebar-start] 8rem [sidebar-start grid-start] 1fr 
[center-start] repeat (8, [col-start] minmax(min-content, 14rem) [col-end])

## Topic 5 building features part 2

- we dont define rows many-times in fearure section because we want the row to adapt the content size

- when using -1 as the end of column/grid, that row/column must bed explicit/defined

## Topic - 7 Building the Story Section 

atomic CSS = styling with small unique css classes

aligning in flex-box

justify-content = y-axis/column
align-items = x-axis/row

aligning items in css grids

/*
display: grid;
align-content = y-axis/column
justify-items = x-axis/row
align-items  = aligns the content

- justify-items = align grids item  in grid cells horizantly 

- there is no way style css grid gaps indvidualy for columns and rows seprately at this time 2017. may be in the future search it.
- always use display: flex; to align elements side by side
- in this time(2017) column-gap is not availbale in flexbobx, but in future 2020 and beyod there will be column and row gap, instead of where we set marging-rigth to the svg item we can set column-gap to the parent element

## Topic 10&11. Building the Gallery 

- object-fit  is used for images in grid , it's like background-size = cover; 
- we  need the image to have parent container and set img to object fit, to use obejct fit image must have height nad width specified

- deciding 
- the more row/columns = the more variatey and shapes we can create with grid

- grid-column: 3 / span 3;
- span 3 = stands for stretch/add 3 column or row, so start from 3 until end of 5 thats 3 columns

## Topic 14&15 - Building the header

- manage vertical spacing with grid
- using ::after and before pseduos as grid items

- numbers we put in the grid-template properties are stand for row/or colum 
- grid-temlate-rows: 1strow 2ndrow 3rdrow 4throw etc..;
