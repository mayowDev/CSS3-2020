      Chapter 4 : Intro to SASS and NPM
        =================================
Sass = css with elegence and super powers
browser dont know sass code, so we have to process to convert into css

Mian SASS features:
* variables= re-usable values such as colors, fonts
* Nesting= nest selectors inside one another. Less code
* mixins = Re-usable code
* Partials and imports = seprate and component based css files
* Operators= mathematical operators inside css
* Functions= similar to mixins, but produce valus that can be used. 
* Extends = to make different selectors inherit Declaration that are common
* Controll Directives = for writing  complex code  using conditionals and loops(not covered in this corse)

Sass syntax = indantation sensttive. no brackets, n columns.
SCSS syntax = indantation, brackets, columns. just like css syntax

variables, nesting, mixins, etends, functions
-how our background color disappeared and fixed by clear fix
-built in functions lighten and darken
- functions in sass

@function divide($a, $b){ @return $a / $b};
border-radius: divide(100, 2) * 1px; the * 1px is giving unit 

@extend use  %placeholder where you store data and then @extedn that placeholder
Diff b/w extends and mixins: @extends copy the code you extending to the place holder
while mixins are the opposite
-only use extends when the rules we are extending are inherently and thematically related
in our case the buttons are related
-

* mixins are like function in javascript. they take prameters
you can call them at some point with or without the prameters

--- Lesson 5 Intro to command line
mv = move
rm or del = remove forver
rm -r = delete recursively files and folder
cp = copy
Motivation
open image.png = opens the file

--- Lesson 6 Install sass and intro to npm

--save = save to the package.js or it' will not be shown on package.json
--save-dev = save as dev-dependenies

--lesson 7. NPM Scripts Let's Write and Compile Sass Locally

write this script in your package.json

"compile": "node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.css -w

* the sass/main.scss is the entry point
* the css/style.css is the out point
-w stands: for watch changes automatically, so we dont have to run the script

                Lesson 8. Reloading a Page on File Changes
- npm install live-server -g
- Call from everywhere "live-server" command
- or install the vs-code extension live-server
