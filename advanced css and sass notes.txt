lesson 3 Building header part1

main points in the lesson: 

A: Best way to perform a basic reset is using the * universal selector
B: Setting project-wide definitions
C: new css feature, how to clip parts of elements using clip-path

* {margin:0; paddingn:0; box-sizing: border-box;} 
A= the starnoight * is a universal selector
by defualt browsers apply some margin and padding to some elements

B: properties placed in body element are inhertated to all the childs 
of the body , except the padding and marging. because that applies to body
* body{font-family:sans-serif, font-weight:400; font-size:16px;line-height:1.7; color:#777}
* 1.7 of line-height  means, mulitply by the oringal line-heihgt by 1.7 times

* vh = view port height, so 95vh means fit the element to 95% of the view heigt port
* background-position: top; menas the top of the image stays the same
*background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #color1, #color2), url(); 
that makes the image stay at the top and gradient bottom, 
the order has to be liner first and image second
* the firs pramter of the liner gradient is used to determine where 
the gradient goes .  
for example: to righ bottom; the gradient would start from
letf top to right bottom

* The Clip path new css feature
    ==========================
Tool: https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/
we used polygon property to make skew on right bottom
* The polygon takes 4 cordinates/pramters of x and y axis, which stands  for
the 4 couners of the element where we want to be visible.
* It starts from the left-top corner and goes clockwise like below:-
  top-left -> top-right -> right-bottom -> left-bottom.

    Examples of Polygon
    ==================

 -create traiangle : clip-path: polygon(50% 0, 100% 100%, 0 100%);
 -create skewed botom right: clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 50%, 0 100%);
 -create skewd like the monal restaurent: clip-path: polygon(0 50%, 100% 0, 100% 50%, 0 100%);

 Explanation of the triangel polygon: 
 
 the triangel takes three prameter, beacause it's tree side
 -first pramter moves/pushes 50% from x-axis and 0 from y-axis
 so it will start from top-center. if we make 50% both, it will start from midl-center
 -the second parmter tells the co-ordinate to move 100% to x-axis from where
 it was standing which is the top-left center and 100% to y-axis which goes
 all the way to right-bottom.
 -the third pramter of the co-ordinate moves 0 from  x-axis 
 and 100% to y-axis, so it will meet the first co-ordinate at top-center
